# Quantium Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage)

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the *Quantium Data Analytics Job Simulation* completed on Forage in [Feb, 2025]. The simulation focused on delivering data-driven insights for a supermarket client, involving data preparation, customer analytics, uplift testing, and strategic reporting.

- **Duration**: ~10 hours, self-paced
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook, PowerPoint
- **Skills**: Data cleaning, EDA, time series analysis, customer segmentation, visualization, commercial insights

## Project Tasks
1. **Data Preparation & Customer Analytics**
   - Cleaned and analyzed transaction datasets to extract customer purchasing trends.
   - Delivered actionable insights for commercial recommendations.

2. **Uplift Testing with Benchmark Stores**
   - Identified benchmark stores for trial layout testing using analytical metrics.
   - Evaluated performance to support evidence-based decisions.

3. **Reporting for Category Manager**
   - Created a comprehensive report with visualizations, summarizing insights and strategic recommendations.

## Key Outputs
- **Visuals**: Sales trends, benchmark comparisons (see `/visuals/`)
- **Report**: Final presentation for Category Manager (see `/reports/`)
- **Code**: Jupyter notebooks for each task (see `/notebooks/`)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Quantium-Data-Analytics-Simulation.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks in `/notebooks/` using Jupyter.

## Reflections
This simulation enhanced my ability to translate raw data into business value, bridging my geophysics background with practical data analytics. Key learnings include customer segmentation and presenting insights concisely for stakeholders.
